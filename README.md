Code examples and textbook used for Less CSS course (PT/EN)

I am updating a very basic Less 1.3 short course to a more detailed Less 1.7 longer course. I plan to make all the code examples and text available in Portuguese (and as soon as possible, in English as well.)

I'm using as a main source the less docs, but also created new examples, exercises, mostly focused on each topic, but also some larger ones focused on specific problems. In this first sprint, I will cover each topic and show examples, somewhat like a reference, but then I should reorder some topics and add some cookbook examples. Interesting examples and tutorial topics will be contributed back to the less docs if they can be helpful.



Exemplos de código e apostila usada para curso de Less (PT/EN)

Estou atualizando o material de Less (para a versão 1.7) e irei disponibilizar todos os exemplos de código e texto assim que terminar, em português, e logo que possível, também em inglês.
